## Caltech Pedestrians Dataset
The Caltech Pedestrian Dataset consists of approximately 10 hours of 640x480 30Hz video taken from a vehicle driving through regular traffic in an urban environment. About 250,000 frames (in 137 approximately minute long segments) with a total of 350,000 bounding boxes and 2300 unique pedestrians were annotated. The annotation includes temporal correspondence between bounding boxes and detailed occlusion labels.
