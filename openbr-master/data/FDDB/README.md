## FDDB Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark
Unconstrained face detection dataset containing 2845 images with 5171 annotated face locations. Contained in this directory are .FDDB files for train and test splits for FDDB. These are based on the `FDDB-folds` directory that comes with the original dataset, but organized as 10 different train/test splits instead of 10 folds. All splits are based on the original folds.

Image data currently available online.
